              The kind of token {option}`registrationConfigFile` provides.

              `"authentication"` (the default) treats it as a runner
              authentication token (the `glrt-` prefix), created for the runner
              in the GitLab UI or API. config.toml is written with the token
              directly and the runner authenticates on its own; no
              `gitlab-runner register` runs. From GitLab 18.0 this is the only
              supported token type.

              `"registration"` treats it as a deprecated registration token,
              which `gitlab-runner register` exchanges for a runner token,
              setting the runner's server-side attributes ({option}`tagList`,
              {option}`runUntagged`, {option}`protected`,
              {option}`maximumTimeout`) at creation.
